              <img class="devan" src="/img/me 5.jpg" alt="Devan Talley">
              <p maxlength="50">My name is Devan Talley and I am a recent graduate from Eastern Washington University. I received a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Visual Communication Design, a minor in Entrepreneurship, and a certificate in User Experience Design and Web Design. Last spring, I interned with an all in one graphic design agency covering advertising, branding, and videography. At MojoLab, I gained experience in social media marketing, collaborating with clients, logo design, and teamwork. Learning from this experience, I plan to head home to the Seattle area to further expand my design knowledge in UX/UI.
                  Being a team leader is very important to me as I want to lead others to make a positive impact on our society. Playing collegiate soccer for four years has taught me to work well with others and to problem solve. Being a team captain has showed me that leaders become great not because of their power, but because of their ability to empower others.</p>
